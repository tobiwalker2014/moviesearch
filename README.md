# Movie Search App with React Hooks
Welcome to the Movie Search App built with React Hooks! This project aims to demonstrate the power and simplicity of React's new Hooks API by creating a movie search application entirely with functional components.

## Overview
This application allows users to search for movies using the OMDB API and view the results in a simple and intuitive interface. It serves as a practical example of how React Hooks can be utilized to manage state, handle side effects, and create reusable logic within functional components.
